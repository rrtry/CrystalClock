The PlayStation 2 internal display clock is a graphical display found on the PlayStation 2 game console, which consists of a series of flying orbs and rotating hexagon crystal rods that make up the face of an analog 12-hour clock. This clock can be seen in the background of the PS2's internal System Configuration menu, and is kept in sync with the PlayStation 2 internal time-keeping clock.
